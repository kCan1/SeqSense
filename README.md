# 🔢 SeqSense

A Flutter project focused on visualizing and experimenting with popular number sequences and mathematical algorithms. Built using FlutterFlow, this app provides a clean and interactive interface for exploring Collatz, Fibonacci, Lucas, Tribonacci, Pascal's Triangle, Euclidean Algorithm, and more.

## 🚀 Features

- 📈 Interactive implementation of number sequences:
  - Collatz Sequence
  - Fibonacci Sequence
  - Tribonacci Sequence
  - Lucas Numbers
  - Pascal's Triangle
- 📐 Euclidean Algorithm visualization
- 🛠️ Modular architecture with custom logic in `custom_code`
- 🏠 Clean landing UI in `homepage`
- 🔄 State management via `app_state.dart`
- ⚙️ Built with FlutterFlow & customized in native Dart
